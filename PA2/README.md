Colorado State University cs510 spring 2024 assignment for team 2 repository

# Description
In this assignment you are to take four trackers already part of OpenCV and compare their performance on three videos provided here and two additional videos of your own choosing. If you are looking for background information on trackers provided in OpenCV you might want to start with Satya Mallick's posting "Object Tracking using OpenCV"

Here is a link to the class dataset. You can download the files in a .zip format from the "dataset" dropdown menu.

Each student is expected to work on this project as a member of a two person team. These updated teams will remain for the rest of the semester. Please view the updated teams here.

The first part of this assignment is to simply bring up OpenCV in an environment where you and your partner are comfortable working. Next, it is to learn the basics of loading a video from a file, running a tracker, and displaying the results of the tracker on a frame-by-frame basis.

The second part will be to select four trackers and get familiar with how they perform on the dataset. In each case, broadly speaking the goal of the tracker is to track the moving object, i.e. the dvd logo, cat, snowboarder. A bit of a warning, tracking the objects approaching the camera may force you think about object size and deal with some complexities missing from simpler tracking tasks.

The third part is to give some thought about what you are seeing, in particular what is working and what may not be working, and then select three a videos which will serve to let you expand upon what you've observed and seen.

Finally, any good comparison of algorithms should include a qualitative and a quantitative component. Clearly the qualitative comparison may take the form of a very few (two to three paragraphs) key observations of the 3 videos you've picked from the dataset. Quantitative may involve a bit more work, starting with you deciding how you want to quantify performance. You should report quantitative performance metrics for all of the videos in the dataset. 

Additionally, you should produce as a part of your short demo presentation on this project at least one quantitative summary/comparison of the four algorithms you have selected applied to the five videos you are analyzing. That you are being given little guidance about what to measure is no mistake. Part of this assignment is working out with your partner what you think makes the most sense. Obviously, you will want to review briefly the literature on trackers and see how quantitative comparisons are typically presented.

You will be asked to submit a brief report, no more then 3 pages total including the graphics/plot summarizing the quantitative part of your comparison along with your code. Then, each project team will be scheduled into a 15 minute presentation slot with the instructor where you will be expected to show your tracker working. It will be up to you to pick no more than three video-tracker combinations to highlight in this presentation.
